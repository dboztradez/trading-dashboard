Daily Crypto Report (July 30, 2025): BTC ~$60,000...

#### Bitcoin (BTC/USD)
- **Current Price**: $119,250 (up 0.45% in the past 24 hours)[](https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)
- **Technical Analysis**:
  - **Support**: $114,000 (key level from recent consolidation)
  - **Resistance**: $120,000 (recent high, psychological barrier)
  - **RSI**: 69 (nearing overbought, suggesting caution)
  - **MACD**: Bullish crossover, histogram showing positive momentum
  - **Trend**: Consolidating within a bullish pennant on the 1H chart, indicating potential for continuation but risk of a trap[](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)
- **Fundamental Factors**:
  - **Market Sentiment**: Risk-on sentiment prevails, supported by positive economic climate and institutional interest (e.g., BlackRock’s ETF inflows). Profit-taking caused a minor 2.3% dip, but analysts view it as a temporary correction.[](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/)
  - **Regulatory News**: No major regulatory updates in the past 24 hours, but improving U.S. regulatory environment boosts sentiment.[](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/ripple-price-forecast-could-open-interest-buy-signals-coinbase-derivatives-backed-xrp-futures-drive-price-to-3-202504210500)
- **Trade Idea**:
  - **Entry**: Buy at $119,500 (post-consolidation breakout confirmation).
  - **Target**: $122,000 (next resistance zone).
  - **Stop-Loss**: $117,500 (below recent support).
  - **Rationale**: Bullish MACD and pennant breakout suggest upward momentum, but RSI nearing 70 warrants tight risk management.[](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)

- **Current Price**: $3,820 (down 0.22% in the past 24 hours)[](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/)

  - **Resistance**: $3,900 (near-term target)
  - **RSI**: 67 (bullish momentum intact but cooling)
  - **MACD**: Bearish crossover on 1D timeframe, signaling potential short-term pullback[](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/)
  - **Trend**: Testing horizontal resistance at $3,641.87, with a bearish outlook if rejected[](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/)
