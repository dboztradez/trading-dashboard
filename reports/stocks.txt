Weekly Stock Report (Aug 3, 2025): JPM ~$212...
**Investment Horizon:** 1–2 Weeks  

---

### Market Context  
The US stock market has shown resilience in the past week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reaching fresh all-time highs, driven by strong Q2 earnings and positive trade developments. The S&P 500 gained approximately 1.5% for the week, supported by strength in industrials and financials, though near-term overbought conditions are signaled by RSI readings around 76. The looming August 1, 2025, tariff deadline has introduced uncertainty, with President Trump announcing a trade deal with Japan (reducing auto tariffs from 27.5% to 15%) and ongoing negotiations with the EU, Canada, and others. Investors are focusing on solid fundamentals, such as consumer spending and corporate earnings, which have largely offset tariff-related concerns. Key events this week include an FOMC meeting, mega-cap tech earnings (META, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL), and the monthly jobs report, which could introduce volatility.[](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/weekly-traders-outlook)[](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/weekly-traders-outlook)[](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/is-a-market-correction-coming.html)

- **Market Risks:** The FOMC meeting, tech earnings, and jobs report this week could trigger volatility. Overbought RSI levels in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suggest potential consolidation.  [](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/weekly-traders-outlook)

- **Strategy:** Use tight stop-losses to manage event-driven volatility. Combine technical signals (MACD, RSI, volume) with fundamental catalysts for higher-probability trades. Backtest strategies on platforms like TradingView to refine entry/exit points.  [](https://www.kavout.com/market-lens/trading-signals-and-technical-indicators-for-effective-market-scanning)
